## 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Retail Sales Data

### Description:
In this project, the goal is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing retail sales information. The aim is to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that can help the retail business make informed decisions.

### Key Concepts and Challenges:
- **Data Loading and Cleaning**: Load the retail sales dataset.
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculate basic statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation).
- **Time Series Analysis**: Analyze sales trends over time using time series techniques.
- **Customer and Product Analysis**: Analyze customer demographics and purchasing behavior.
- **Visualization**: Present insights through bar charts, line plots, and heatmaps.
- **Recommendations**: Provide actionable recommendations based on the EDA.

## 2. Predicting House Prices with Linear Regression

### Description:
The objective of this project is to build a predictive model using linear regression to estimate house prices. The project provides hands-on experience in developing, evaluating, and interpreting a predictive model based on a dataset with relevant features.

### Key Concepts and Challenges:
- **Data Collection**: Obtain a dataset with numerical features and a target variable for prediction.
- **Data Exploration and Cleaning**: Explore the dataset to understand its structure, handle missing values, and ensure data quality.
- **Feature Selection**: Identify relevant features that may contribute to the predictive model.
- **Model Training**: Implement linear regression using Scikit-Learn.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) or R-squared.
- **Visualization**: Create visualizations to illustrate the relationship between the predicted and actual values.

## 3. Data Cleaning Project

### Description:
Data cleaning involves fixing or removing incorrect, corrupted, duplicate, or incomplete data within a dataset. This project demonstrates essential data cleaning techniques, focusing on ensuring data accuracy and reliability.

### Key Concepts and Challenges:
- **Data Integrity**: Ensuring the accuracy, consistency, and reliability of data.
- **Missing Data Handling**: Handling missing values by either imputing or removing the affected rows/columns.
- **Duplicate Removal**: Identifying and eliminating duplicate records to maintain data uniqueness.
- **Standardization**: Ensuring consistent formatting across the dataset for accurate analysis.
- **Outlier Detection**: Identifying and addressing outliers that may skew analysis or model performance.
